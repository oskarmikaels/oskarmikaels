👋 Hi, I'm @oskarmikaels

👀 I have a profound interest in C++ and the JUCE framework, fueled by my extensive background in music and sound engineering. 
The world of music plugins fascinates me, as it perfectly aligns with my passion for music and technical expertise. 
While my heart beats strongest for music, I find coding and problem-solving to be intellectually stimulating and a fresh way to exercise creativity. I'm open to any coding opportunity that promises growth and development.

🌱 Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in C#, C++, and Python. My learning journey is geared towards a future in the audio and music programming industry, and I'm dedicated to evolving until I reach that goal.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that intersect with audio programming, especially those that utilize my skills in C++ and my passion for music. 
However, I'm also keen on engaging in any innovative coding and problem-solving projects that can broaden my horizons.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me at oskarmikaels@gmail.com.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a social, kind, and curious individual with an open mindset towards the wonderful life we live. I embrace new experiences and knowledge with enthusiasm and joy.
